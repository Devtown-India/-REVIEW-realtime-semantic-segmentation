# Realtime Semantic Segmentation
It is a web application that helps us to segment the objects in real world and helps us to classify the objects.

### Description:
This project includes the segmentation and classification of  objects in real time using a web app . It helps us to identify the objects based on the color code that is assigned and helps us to identify the objects using the help of DeepLearning and Machine Learning techniques.

### Dataset:
This project is based on the PASCAL VOC 2012 DATASET [link](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar).The dataset involves 21 classes where 20 classes refer to various objects and the remaining referring to the background.Each class is assigned an unique color.

The classes in the project include:

>Person

>Bird, cat, cow, dog, horse, sheep

>Aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bus, car, motorbike, train

>Bottle, chair, dining table, potted plant, sofa, tv/ monitor

>Background


In this project we have used the weights of  pretrained model (PSPNet). It has been converted into a set of model.json and a group of sharable bin files(4 files).

Refer to this [documentation](https://huningxin.github.io/tfjs-converter/).

### Technologies Used:
1.React JS
2.HTML
3.CSS
4.ML and DL(model)
5.Tensorflow.js [refer](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)

### Steps to run the code:
1.First install node.js [link](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.3/node-v12.18.3-x64.msi)

2.Then install npm by running [npm install](" ")

3.Then create a react app by typing [npx create-react-app my-app](" ")

4.Move to that repository by [cd my-app](" ")

5.Then check if all are set up by runnning [npm start](" ")

6.Clone this repository to your pc/laptop

7.Open a suitable editor such as VSCode,Atom,etc which is preferred to you.

8.Copy all the files according to the file structure shown below:
